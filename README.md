# About Me
I'm a Data Scientist and a graduate student at UC Berkeley's Master in Data Science (MIDS) program projected to graduate in 2025.
Currently I am working as a consulting Data Scientist for National Capitol Contracting helping deliver insights for 
Naval Sea Systems Command at Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard. Before going into data science, I was an Army Infantry Officer and later managed multiple 
construction projects in Hawaii as a consulting Construction Manager/Project Engineer.

# Projects
In my time at MIDS, I have had the opportunity to work on several projects. Most work is on going, but here are some of the completed
projects that I can share with you. 

<summary>SQL and NoSQL for analyzing customer sales information and make recommendations for future expansion of food delivery distribution sites.</summary>
</details>
<ul><li>Course: Data Engineering </li>
<li>Description: Project 1: Data Wrangling to load sales data from a third party sales channel with preliminary analytics. Used AWS and docker cluster running Anaconda and Postgres SQL
Project 2: Create Neo4J graph database for Bay Area BART system to identify future distribution location for food delivery service. Use Graph Path to identify shortest path from central 
supply store to distribution nodes, centrality algorithm to determine most influential BART station to service existing customers, and community detection algorithm to identify BART station communities. Identified additional BART Station location for future store expansion. 
<li>Technology: SQL, Python, NoSQL Graph Database, Relational Database, Linux CL, Dockers, Graph Path, Centrality, Community Detection Algorithms, </li>

<summary>Hypothesis Testing and multiple variable large sample linear regression</summary>
<ul><li>Course: Statistics for Data Science </li>
<li>Description: Project 1: A project exploring, visualizing, and Hypothesis testing whether Republican Voters or Democrat Voters 
have more difficulty in voting. Project 2: A project evaluating if one's occupation impacts the amount of hours worked weekly using general census data. </li>
