# About Me
I'm a Data Scientist and a graduate student at UC Berkeley's Master in Data Science (MIDS) program projected to graduate in 2025.
Currently I am working as a consulting Data Scientist for National Capitol Contracting helping deliver insights for 
Naval Sea Systems Command at Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard. Before going into data science, I was an Army Infantry Officer and later managed multiple 
construction projects in Hawaii as a consulting Construction Manager/Project Engineer.
