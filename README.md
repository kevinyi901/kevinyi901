# About Me
I'm a Data Scientist and a current graduate student at UC Berkeley's Master in Data Science (MIDS) program projected to graduate in 2025.  
Currently, I am working as a Data Scientist for National Capitol Contracting, helping deliver strategic insights and building automation for Naval Sea Systems Command at Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard. Before going into data science, I was an Army Infantry Officer and later managed multiple construction projects in Hawaii as a consulting Construction Manager/Project Engineer. I am a graduate of the United States Military Academy with an undegraduate degree in Civil Engineering. 

# Projects
In my time at MIDS, I have had the opportunity to work on several projects. Most work is ongoing, but here are some of the completed projects that I can share with you:

<details>
<summary>SQL and NoSQL for analyzing customer sales information and making recommendations for future expansion of food delivery distribution sites</summary>
<ul>
<li><strong>Course:</strong> Data Engineering</li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong>  
Project 1: Data Wrangling to load sales data from a third-party sales channel with preliminary analytics. Used AWS and a Docker cluster running Anaconda and PostgreSQL.  
Project 2: Created a Neo4J graph database for the Bay Area BART system to identify future distribution locations for a food delivery service. Used Graph Path to identify the shortest path from a central supply store to distribution nodes, a centrality algorithm to determine the most influential BART station to service existing customers, and a community detection algorithm to identify BART station communities. Identified additional BART station locations for future store expansion.</li>
<li><strong>Technology:</strong> SQL, Python, NoSQL Graph Database, Linux CLI, Docker Containers, Graph Path, Centrality, Community Detection Algorithms</li>

<summary>Hypothesis Testing and Multiple Variable Large Sample Linear Regression</summary>
<ul>
<li><strong>Course:</strong> Statistics for Data Science</li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong>  
Project 1: A project exploring, visualizing, and conducting hypothesis testing on whether Republican voters or Democrat voters have more difficulty voting.  
Project 2: A project evaluating if one's occupation impacts the amount of hours worked weekly using general census data.</li>
<li><strong>Technology:</strong> R Studio, T-Test, Classical Linear Model Assumption Testing, Multi-Variate Linear Regression</li>
