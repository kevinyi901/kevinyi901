# About Me
ðŸ‘‹ About Me

Hi, Iâ€™m Kevin Yi â€” a Principal Data Engineer with a background as a U.S. Army officer and civil engineer, now focused on data science, machine learning, and large-scale data systems. Iâ€™m currently pursuing my Master of Information and Data Science at UC Berkeley, where Iâ€™m working on projects in predictive modeling, distributed computing, and AI applications at scale.

I specialize in designing and automating real-time data pipelines, building machine learning models that drive actionable insights, and creating dashboards and monitoring systems that ensure reliability in mission-critical environments. My experience spans defense, engineering, and enterprise analytics, and I enjoy tackling problems where technology directly impacts operations and decision-making.

Iâ€™m passionate about combining technical depth with leadership experience to help organizations use data more effectively.

# Projects
In my time at MIDS, I have had the opportunity to work on several projects. Most work is ongoing, but here are some of the completed projects that I can share with you:

<details>
<summary> Food delivery company customer and distribution site analytics</summary>
<ul>
<li><strong>Course:</strong> Data Engineering</li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong>  
Project 1: Data Wrangling to load sales data from a third-party sales channel with preliminary analytics. Used AWS and a Docker cluster running Anaconda and PostgreSQL.  
Project 2: Created a Neo4J graph database for the Bay Area BART system to identify future distribution locations for a food delivery service. Used Graph Path to identify the shortest path from a central supply store to distribution nodes, a centrality algorithm to determine the most influential BART station to service existing customers, and a community detection algorithm to identify BART station communities. Identified additional BART station locations for future store expansion.</li>
<li><strong>Technology:</strong> SQL, Python, NoSQL Graph Database, Linux CLI, Docker Containers, Graph Path, Centrality, Community Detection Algorithms</li>
